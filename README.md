Hellpoint Save Editor
---

Fairly bare-bones. I may add more features in the future, maybe not.

You can edit:
- Inventory, add/delete items, change proficiencies, quantities, etc.
- Player stats.
- World stats.
- Equipment.

It'll ask you which file to open on startup.<br>
Ctrl+S saves.
That's basically it for the interface.

There's a few known bugs. 'Temporary' solutions that have become good enough for my purposes to not be worhth the time to fix the right way.
- You may need to leave the cell/box you're editing for the change to be committed for saving.
- Trying to remove an item in use in a socket causes a crash. This is deliberte to avoid breaking the save.
