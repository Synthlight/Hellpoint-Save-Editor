Hellpoint Save Editor
---

Fairly bare-bones. I may add more features in the future, maybe not.

You can edit:
- Inventory, add/delete items, change proficiencies, quantities, etc.
- Player stats.
- World stats.
- Equipment.

It'll ask you which file to open on startup.<br>
Ctrl+S saves.
That's basically it for the interface.

Known issues:
- Trying to remove an item in use in a socket causes a crash. This is deliberte to avoid breaking the save.


**[Microsoft. NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) is required to run the editor.**
